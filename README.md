After building software for visualizing galaxies during my two week internship at the Center for Astronomy in Heidelberg 2017, I condinued working on the project: First of all, I generated my own data (star positions) and when I had enough of stars, I tried simulating them and had fun playing around with the limitations that arose.

In the end, the repos here emerged. Keep in mind: I had no real prior knowledge, so looking back, most of the stuff here is kind of bad (I'd hope so, as if it wouldn't look like it, I wouldn't have learnt anything since then).
